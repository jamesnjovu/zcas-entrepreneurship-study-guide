The Minister argued that in order for entrepreneurs to survive in a hostile and competitive environment, they should always seek to meet or exceed the expectations of their stakeholders like customers, suppliers, employees, financial institutions, Government and its Agencies and family and friends, among others. The Minister emphasized that Zambian entrepreneurs ought to fully understand what entrepreneurship is in a perspective, in order for them (entrepreneurs) to strategically position themselves in the marketplace. The Minister implored ZDA and the National Coordinating Committee for the Buy Zambian Products Campaign to design robust programmes and activities that can stimulate quality improvement and operational efficiencies among Zambian MSMEs.`,

            context: `At a recent Annual General Meeting (AGM) of the Zambia Chamber of Commerce and Industry (ZACCI), one of the keynote speakers emphasized that Zambian entrepreneurs can survive in a very competitive business environment by becoming more and more innovative. The speaker argued that entrepreneurs must meet or exceed stakeholder expectations ‚Äî including customers, suppliers, employees, financiers, government agencies, and communities. After the AGM, a group of entrepreneurs in Solwezi organized a week-long Entrepreneurship Skills Training workshop under the theme ‚ÄúInnovation is key in a competitive environment.‚Äù You, as a ZCAS University student, have been invited to help them understand what factors trigger innovation in entrepreneurs.`,
