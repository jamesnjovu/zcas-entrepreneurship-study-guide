            context: `At a recent meeting with the Zambia Development Agency (ZDA) and the National Coordinating Committee for the Buy Zambian Products Campaign, to discuss how to enhance the quality of Zambian products manufactured by Micro, Small and Medium Sized Enterprises (MSMEs), the Minister of Commerce, Trade and Industry, Honourable Chipoka Mulenga, MP, as the Guest of Honour contended that one way in which Zambian entrepreneurs can survive in a very competitive business environment is by becoming more and more innovative in their dealings with various business stakeholders. The Minister argued that in order for entrepreneurs to survive in a hostile and competitive environment, they should always seek to meet or exceed the expectations of their stakeholders like customers, suppliers, employees, financial institutions, Government and its Agencies and family and friends, among others. The Minister emphasized that Zambian entrepreneurs ought to fully understand what entrepreneurship is in a perspective, in order for them (entrepreneurs) to strategically position themselves in the marketplace. The Minister implored ZDA and the National Coordinating Committee for the Buy Zambian Products Campaign to design robust programmes and activities that can stimulate quality improvement and operational efficiencies among Zambian MSMEs.`,
