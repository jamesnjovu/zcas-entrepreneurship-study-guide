# Fix GitHub Pages Deployment Issue

The deployment errors occur because of GitHub Pages environment configuration issues. Here's how to fix them:

## üéØ RECOMMENDED SOLUTION: Use the Simple Workflow

**Step 1: Disable the current workflow**
1. Rename `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` to `.github/workflows/deploy.yml.disabled`
2. This prevents the problematic workflow from running

**Step 2: Use the working workflow**
- The file `.github/workflows/deploy-simple.yml` is already configured and ready
- It uses `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v4` which bypasses environment restrictions
- This workflow will automatically deploy to the `gh-pages` branch

**Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages**
1. Go to https://github.com/jamesnjovu/zcas-entrepreneurship-study-guide/settings/pages
2. Under **Source**, select **Deploy from a branch**
3. Choose **Branch**: `gh-pages` and **Folder**: `/ (root)`
4. Click **Save**

## Alternative Solution: Fix Environment Protection Rules

If you want to keep using the official GitHub Pages Actions:

1. Go to repository **Settings** ‚Üí **Environments** ‚Üí **github-pages**
2. Under **Deployment branches**, select **No restriction**
3. Click **Save protection rules**

## Expected Results

After implementing the recommended solution:
- Push to main branch triggers automatic deployment
- Site deploys to https://jamesnjovu.github.io/zcas-entrepreneurship-study-guide/
- No environment permission issues

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Build process works perfectly
- ‚úÖ Static export configuration ready  
- ‚úÖ Working deployment workflow created (`deploy-simple.yml`)
- ‚ùå Original workflow blocked by environment rules

## Next Steps
1. Rename `deploy.yml` to `deploy.yml.disabled`
2. Push changes to trigger the simple deployment workflow
3. Check Actions tab to confirm successful deployment
